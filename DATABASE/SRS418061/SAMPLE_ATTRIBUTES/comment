str,Wild-type, pin6-2 (SALK_046393), and myb7-2 (SALK_030969) A. thaliana plants were grown on soil in individual pots under a 16h day (150 microE m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation)/8h night cycle for 30-35 days as described previously (Kram et al. 2009). RNA was isolated from pooled lateral nectaries of Stage 14-15 flowers as previously described (~300 pooled nectaries per sample; Kram et al. 2009). The pin6-2 and myb57-2 mutants partially phenocopy each other in producing less nectar and often missing one or both short stamen.
